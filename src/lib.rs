///
/// Note: The following documentation is adapted from petgraph's [**Graph** documentation]
/// (http://bluss.github.io/petulant-avenger-graphlibrary/doc/petgraph/graph/struct.Graph.html).
///
/// **Dag** is parameterized over the node weight **N**, edge weight **E** and index type **Ix**.
///
/// **NodeIndex** is a type that acts as a reference to nodes, but these are only stable across
/// certain operations. **Removing nodes may shift other indices.** Adding kids to the **Dag**
/// keeps all indices stable, but removing a node will force the last node to shift its index to
/// take its place.
///
/// The fact that the node indices in the **Dag** are numbered in a compact interval from 0 to *n*-1
/// simplifies some graph algorithms.
///
/// The **Ix** parameter is u32 by default. The goal is that you can ignore this parameter
/// completely unless you need a very large **Dag** -- then you can use usize.
///
/// The **Dag** also offers methods for accessing the underlying **Graph**, which can be useful
/// for taking advantage of petgraph's various graph-related algorithms.
